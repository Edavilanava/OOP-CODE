In TypeScript, the term "static" is used to describe properties and methods of a class that belong to the class itself, rather than to any specific instance of the class. These properties and methods can be accessed directly on the class, rather than on an instance of the class.

There are several reasons why the ability to create static members can be useful in a programming language:

It allows for the creation of utility functions or properties that do not need to operate on a specific instance of a class. For example, you might create a static method on a class for generating unique ids for instances of that class.

It can improve performance, as the JavaScript engine can optimize the access to a static property more efficiently than an instance property.

In TypeScript, the protected access modifier is used to restrict the visibility of properties and methods to the class itself and any subclasses that extend it. This allows you to create an object-oriented design where certain members are meant to be accessed or overridden by derived classes, but not directly by external code.

It allows for the creation of a clear hierarchy of classes, where a base class defines certain behavior or state that is meant to be reused by derived classes. This can help to reduce code duplication and improve code maintainability.

It promotes encapsulation, by allowing the implementation details of a class to be hidden from external code, while still allowing derived classes to access and customize those implementation details.

In TypeScript, the private access modifier is used to restrict the visibility of properties and methods to the class itself. This means that the properties and methods with private access modifier can only be accessed from within the class in which they are defined, and cannot be accessed from outside the class.

It allows for the implementation details of a class to be hidden from external code, promoting encapsulation and making the class more robust to changes.

It can help to ensure that the internal state of an object is always in a valid state, by preventing external code from modifying the object's state in an unexpected way.
